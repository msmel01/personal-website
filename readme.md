## Resources used:
* [Another menu concept](https://codepen.io/RSH87/pen/rmgYbo)
* [Filtering elements](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_elements.asp)

## To Do:
* Put position descriptions in timeline section.
* Add on scroll animation to experiences.
* Add background to nav menu once scrolled past hero page on mobile page.
* Colors still needs some work.

## Ideas:
* Change hero to Hello World in code, followed by my name is Melika. Add an about me page where I talk about education and areas of interest.
